## Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of web security, understanding and overcoming Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) is a crucial skill for ethical hackers engaged in bug bounty programs. WAFs play a pivotal role in safeguarding web applications by blocking common vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL injection, providing server-side protection. This article delves into a specific evasion technique - testing on the real IP address of a web application that resides behind a WAF.

## Understanding WAFs

Before we dive into the technique, let's briefly recap the purpose of a Web Application Firewall. WAFs act as a shield against various web vulnerabilities by blocking malicious traffic and protecting the server from common exploits. Additionally, they often conceal the real IP address of the web application, adding an extra layer of security.

## Evasion Technique: Testing on the Real IP Address

The primary goal in web application testing is often to bypass the WAF. This can be achieved through various techniques such as encoding and obfuscation. However, this article focuses on testing the actual IP address of the web application hidden behind the WAF.

### Practical Steps

To discover the concealed IP address, various tools come in handy for bug bounty hunters. Here are a few recommended tools:

1. **Shoden:** [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io)
    
2. **Censys:** [Censys](https://search.censys.io)
    
3. **IVRE:** [IVRE](https://ivre.rocks)
    
4. **SecurityTrails:** [SecurityTrails](https://securitytrails.com)
    

These tools assist in revealing the real IP address of the web application, allowing testers to proceed with their assessments without hindrance from the WAF.

## Overcoming WAF Limitations

Once armed with the actual IP address, the WAF is no longer an obstacle to testing attempts. However, it's crucial to note that there may still be client-side filtrations in place, necessitating further bypass techniques.

### Important Note

While discovering the original IP address of a web application is integral to effective testing, it's essential to exercise caution. In some cases, this information can lead to unintended access to sensitive or unprotected admin panels and pages. This unintended access might be a valid finding in itself, highlighting potential vulnerabilities or bugs.

### Conclusion

Navigating the intricacies of WAFs is a critical aspect of bug bounty programs, and understanding how to test on the real IP address adds an invaluable skill to an ethical hacker's toolkit. As web security continues to evolve, staying informed about the latest techniques and tools is paramount for success in uncovering vulnerabilities and contributing to the overall improvement of web application security.
